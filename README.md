# 📈 Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data

## 📝 Description

Extracting essential data from a dataset and displaying it visually is a core skill in data science. This project focuses on retrieving and analyzing Tesla (TSLA) stock & Gamestop (GEM) and revenue data. The data is processed and displayed using visualizations to support insights and help in making data-driven decisions.

This project was completed as part of a data science assignment to demonstrate the ability to:
